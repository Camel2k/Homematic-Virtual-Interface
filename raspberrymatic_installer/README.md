If you want to use this on an <a href="https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic">Raspberrymatic CCU</a> , please use this <a href="https://github.com/thkl/Homematic-Virtual-Interface/blob/master/raspberrymatic_installer/hvl-raspb-0.0.2.tar.gz">CCU Addon</a>. The addon will fetch all necessary files from the web at the first launch. So please note: You will need internet access on your CCU.

The Raspberrymatic Version does not need any manual setup. Just use the WebInterface to fetch new plugins and set them up.
